# SimpleImageRecognizer
A simple image recognize web based on Flask and Tesnsorflow. This project is written in python 3.5, the compatibility with other python version are not verified.

###How to run this web server
1. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and tensorflow 0.10(install tensorflow follow [this](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/get_started/os_setup.md) ).

2. Download the pretrained inception model from  [google 2012 imagenet model](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/image/imagenet/inception-2015-12-05.tgz), put 'classify_image_graph_def.pb','imagenet_2012_challenge_label_map_proto.pbtxt' and 'imagenet_synset_to_human_label_map.txt' into tfwrapper/models.

3. `export FLASK_APP=SimpleImageRecognizer.py` (use `export FLASK_DEBUG=1` to use debug mode )
    if you are using Windows you need to use `set` instead of `export`.

4. Run the Flask web server with `python -m flask run` or `flask run`, to start the Flask build-in server.
   Please note the Flaskâ€™s built-in server is only useful for development, please refer to [this](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/deploying/#deployment) for production deployment. 





###TODO:
- [x] add a requirement file.
- [x] get rid of temp jpg file.
- [ ] use self-trained model.
- [ ] enhance UI.
- [ ] refine imageRcognizer(By now, most code in this file are copied from tf example).
- [ ] use my own model.
- [ ] use my own model.
- [ ] use tensorflow-serving to improve performance.
